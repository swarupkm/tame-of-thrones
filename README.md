# tame-of-thrones

UPDATE
------

After discussion with Clarie, i have updated the error in sample IO and added the allegiance logic.

This repo is meant for solving the geektrust problem statement using test driven style.

The problem statement is based on the link 'https://www.geektrust.in/api/pdf/open/PS5'.

IO tests for first problem statement can be found in com.swarup.tameofthrones.problem1.TestIntegration.

IO tests for second problem statement can be found in com.swarup.tameofthrones.problem2.TestIntegration.

The second integration relies on mocking library to generate random data, so that the assertions can be made consistent.
However unit tests have been added with sample message files. Their the files are read and Ballot messages are generated.

git log can be found to see how the progress was made.
